# Key Objectives:
User Interaction: Create a chatbot that engages users in simple conversations by responding to their inputs.
Predefined Responses: Implement rule-based logic to offer appropriate responses based on keywords detected in user inputs.
Continuous Engagement: Allow the chatbot to engage in a looped conversation until the user exits.
Basic Understanding: Help users with specific questions or statements like greetings, small talk, and farewell messages.
Exit Mechanism: Ensure the chatbot ends the conversation when the user types commands like "bye" or "exit."
# Key Insights:
Simplicity of Rule-based Systems: The chatbot relies on simple if-else logic, making it limited in understanding but easy to implement.
Input Handling: The chatbot processes user input by converting it to lowercase and checking for certain keywords, demonstrating how basic input handling works.
Limitations: Since the chatbot only understands predefined keywords, it's restricted to those responses and can't handle complex queries or freeform conversations.
Scalability: While basic, this structure can be expanded by adding more conditions or integrating a more sophisticated language model for smarter responses.
# key technologies
Backend :

Python/JavaScript (Node.js): For generating random words, if the game pulls from a larger database or handles multiplayer functionality.
APIs: To retrieve word lists or enable multiplayer mode (if applicable).
